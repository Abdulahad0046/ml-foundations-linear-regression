# Linear Regression: Study Hours vs Marks

## Problem
The goal of this project is to understand and implement Linear Regression to predict student marks based on the number of study hours.

## Approach
- Created a simple dataset representing study hours and corresponding marks
- Visualized the data using scatter plots
- Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Predicted marks and plotted the regression line
- Printed model parameters (slope and intercept)

## Output
- A regression line showing the relationship between study hours and marks
- Model parameters:
  - Slope indicates how much marks increase per additional hour of study
  - Intercept represents baseline marks when study hours are zero

## What I Learned
- How Linear Regression works conceptually and mathematically
- The meaning of slope and intercept in real-world terms
- How a model learns patterns from data
- How to visualize model predictions
- How to structure and document a machine learning project
